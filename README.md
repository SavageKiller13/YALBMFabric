YALBM (Yet Another Lucky Block Mod) Is a mod based around being lucky to get certain loot.
This mod is made for Minecraft Fabric 1.16.5 (not tested for 1.17 snapshots as of time of writing; March 21 2021).
This is my first mod made in Fabric (and after a couple years) so expect a few bugs. If you experience a few bugs while playing with this mod Report them in the Builtin Github Issue Tracker.
You may also open an issue for posting any changes you would like to see such as loot to add/remove, recipe changes, blocks to add/remove, items to add/remove and any other features.
If an Issue is opened up as a feature request, anything that is complicated may take some time to add in as this mod is used for learning things about modding.

If you are ever looking for drops for blocks the link is posted on my Curseforge page or below:
